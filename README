🫀 Heart Disease Prediction

Machine Learning project to predict the likelihood of heart disease using patient health records.

📊 Dataset
Source: Kaggle – Heart Disease Data
Includes features like age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol, ECG results, max heart rate, angina, thalassemia, etc.


⚙️ Workflow
1. Data preprocessing (missing values, encoding, scaling)

2. Exploratory analysis (distributions, correlations)

3. Model training & evaluation
Logistic Regression → 84.2% accuracy
Random Forest → 88.6% accuracy ✅

4. Save trained model + scaler (.pkl) and provide template CSV for user inputs
📈 Results
Random Forest performed best with ~88.6% accuracy
Key predictors: age, cholesterol, chest pain type, thalassemia, exercise-induced angina


🛠️ Tech Stack
Python (Colab)
Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Joblib

🚀 Usage
1. Upload kaggle.json in Colab to fetch dataset
2. Run notebook to train & save models
3. Use heart_user_template.csv for input
4. Upload your dataset → get predictions (0 = No Disease, 1 = Disease)
